# Problem
We define the problem as a multinormial classification. 
where each label has two or more different features. 

To simplify the problem, let us assume we have 100 classes, and each class is defined by two features.

1st feature is natural lanaguage based text, like "I did this", "he did so well that ..." ...
2nd feature is code, like "0x123, 0x234, 0x345".  



Say we have 

Nice to see 
```
def hello():
    print("hello,world")
```
