# Problem
    We define the problem as a multinormial classification. 
    where each label has two or more different features. 

    To simplify the problem, let us assume we have a dataset like this:

|label   | feature1  | feature2  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1  | 'Brown fox jumps on smart fox'  | '0x123, 0x234, 0x345, 0x123' |
| A2  | 'Brown fox jumps on stupid fox'  | '0x123, 0x234, 0x345, 0x123' |
| A3  | 'Brown fox jumps on good fox'  | '0x123, 0x234, 0x345, 0x123' |
| A4  | 'Brown fox jumps on bad fox'  | '0x123, 0x234, 0x345, 0x123' |
| A5  | 'Brown big fox jumps on small fox'  | '0x123, 0x234, 0x345, 0x123' |
| A6  | 'Brown fat fox jumps on skinny fox'  | '0x123, 0x234, 0x345, 0x123' |
| ...  | ...  | ...  |
| A100  | 'Brown fox jumps on fox'  | '0x123, 0x234, 0x345, 0x123' |

# Model
    "feature1" is from human natural language which order matters. 
    So it is better to use NLP related method. In this example, we use RNN for this feature.

    "feature2" is generated by machine like a error code log, where order does not matter.
    In this example, we use CNN for this feature.
